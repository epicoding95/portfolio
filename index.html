      <div class ="my-class">
      <p><strong>Hello! My names Kelar Crisp im 23 years old and i'm from Knoxville TN</strong>. I graduated from Halls High School in 2014 and since then
        I've spent most of my adult life working for UPS as an outbound supervisor, which consisted of making daily plans to direct my 10 man crew to fulfil that days objectives.
        Typically in a day we would process anywhere between 8,000-10,000 packages. Since leaving UPS in may of this year i've moved to Seattle,Washington
        to begin my career in the tech industry. Since moving to Seattle just a short couple of weeks ago, i've enrolled into a computer programming class called Epicodus!
        Outside of work/school i enjoy almost all outdoor activities, such as hiking,swimming,fishing, and even just going for long runs. As of right now my goal is
        to compete and finish a marathon before the end of this year!
